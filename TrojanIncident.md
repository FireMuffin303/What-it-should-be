# Trojan/Wacatac.B!ml Incident
As you can see from this page or [Issue#1](https://github.com/FireMuffin303/What-it-should-be/issues/1).
I do need to address the situation before someone found the [Issue#1](https://github.com/FireMuffin303/What-it-should-be/issues/1) and think this mod contains trojan.

During player testing phase, one of my friend got a warning from Window Defender. Says this mod containing Trojan/Wacatac.B!ml

Checking code and reddit. My best guess was false warning or Config file Creation code, which the only thing that could affect anything on computer.
But does nothing harmful at all, rather than just save and load variable from In-Game Settings.

Few days passed, My friend still got the warning. I can't access to VirusTotal for some reason. I decided to make a Youtube Short about the situation to request some help. (I should have ask Official Modding Discord, I know.)

Lots of people tried to help, and I do appreciate everyone who tried to help. But few hours later my friends who got the warning try to download again and completely normal.

After that, The [Issue#1](https://github.com/FireMuffin303/What-it-should-be/issues/1) was placed on 5 Dec 2024. Suspect the same line of code, conclude and closed as False Warning or False Positive from downloading from unauthentic link at 8 Dec 2024 18:03 GMT+7.

The final version was done on 10 Dec 2024. As usual, I sent the file to my friend on Discord for play testing again.

At first, My friend got it normally. Later on 11 Dec 2024 in the morning. My friend got a warning again on downloaded file from 10 Dec 2024 night.

Later I am able to access VirusTotal and running a scan on the file. And got safe result.

<div align="center">
    <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/604bdbc98a589661aab1b7ef37cf873aa065f1b58744ea7745a1f1075a9ecc43">
        Virus Total Result
    </a>
</div>

After got the result. I am pretty sure it was just a false positive all along.

If you got any report that is not false positive and downloaded from Modrinth, feel free to leave in the issue. I'll try to investigate and fix as fast as I could.
